# Currency-detection
# 💵 Indian Currency Detection using OpenCV & Python  

This project is a **Computer Vision application** that detects Indian currency notes (₹10, ₹20, ₹50, ₹100, ₹500) using a webcam.  
It also provides **voice feedback** when a note is detected, making it helpful for **visually impaired users**.

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time **currency note detection** using a laptop webcam.  
- Supports denominations: **₹10, ₹20, ₹50, ₹100, ₹500**.  
- Displays detection results on screen (`"₹20 note detected"`).  
- Provides **audio output** for accessibility.  
- Ends automatically when **Backspace key** is pressed.
